            <p>Geomatics Engineer</p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <p> I hold a Bachelor of Engineering in Geomatics Engineering from Kathmandu University, where I developed a solid foundation in geospatial principles including surveying tools, mapping techniques, Geographic Information Systems (GIS), geospatial programming, Remote Sensing and WebGIS mapping. Building on this academic groundwork, I am currently employed as a Geospatial Application Developer at an intergovernmental organization in Nepal. In this role, I have been responsible for applying data processing and advanced spatial analysis using Google Earth Engine and R programming; creating digital platforms for geovisualization, specializing in Python; and managing spatial databases.
            <br></br>

              I am passionate about geospatial technologies and specialize in creating webgis application softwares. I am exceling myself more in this field and would be happy to serve you.
              What would you do if you had a webgis expert available at your fingertips? üòÅ</p>
